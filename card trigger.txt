Ah, got it—you're looking at the full picture, not just tap-based cards. Let’s step back and frame the activation system cleanly for all card types, so you can handle tap, passive, and trigger cards consistently.

Here’s a structured overview:

1. Activation Method
Method	Description
tap	Player actively taps the card to start its effect. Can have charge/release behaviors.
passive	Always active or provides a modifier without player input. No charge/release.
trigger	Activates automatically when certain conditions in the game are met. Can have cooldowns.
2. Charge (for tap/trigger only)
Charge Type	Description
none	No charging; ability fires immediately (or on second tap if release = tap).
auto	Ability charges itself after initial activation; releases automatically or on second tap.
manual	(Not used in your system) Typically would imply player control like holding down. We skip this.
3. Release (for tap/trigger only)
Release Type	Description
instant	Fires immediately after activation.
auto	Fires automatically after charge completes.
tap	Waits for a second tap to execute.
4. Passive Cards

No charge or release—effect is always on.

Can scale with level.

Can include modifiers, buffs, or stat changes.

Example:

"activation": {
  "method": "passive",
  "charge": "none",
  "release": "instant"
}

5. Trigger Cards

Fires automatically when a condition is met (enemy hits, HP < 50%, etc.).

Can have cooldowns.

Charge/release can still apply if needed.

Example:

"activation": {
  "method": "trigger",
  "charge": "auto",
  "release": "auto"
}


So now, every card—tap, passive, or trigger—fits this activation blueprint. Tap cards just have extra options with charge/release. Passive cards skip that, and trigger cards sit somewhere in between.

If you want, I can make a single table that shows all possible card types + their activation/charge/release combos so you can literally reference it while building your JSON. That way you don’t get lost between tap, passive, and trigger.

Do you want me to do that?
